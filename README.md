# Grand Shooting - Space Shooting Game


# Description
Grand Shooting is a simple Space Shooting game developed using Pygame, a popular Python library for game development. The game allows the player to control a spaceship and shoot down enemy spaceships. The player must avoid colliding with the enemy ships and try to score as many points as possible by shooting them down.

# Features
Player can move the spaceship using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right).
Player can shoot bullets by pressing the Space key.
The game features enemy spaceships that move across the screen and shoot bullets.
When the player's spaceship collides with an enemy spaceship or is hit by an enemy bullet, the game ends.
The game keeps track of the player's score based on the number of enemy spaceships shot down.
# Controls
Arrow Up: Move the spaceship up.

Arrow Down: Move the spaceship down.

Arrow Left: Move the spaceship left.

Arrow Right: Move the spaceship right.

Space: Shoot bullets.

R: Restart the game after game over.
